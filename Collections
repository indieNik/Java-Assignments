3.	Write a class CityStateMap by using child class of java.util.Collection. This mapping class will allow the user to add new city-state pair in to it. User can get the state of the city by calling get method on this class. Duplicate city entries are not allowed,  in such case previous mapping should be replaced with new one. Assume that there is a text file having city state values (in string). Read this file and store these values using CityStateMap class. Let user do the following operations with this class:

1.	Get all cities
2.	Get All states
3.	Get cities for a state
4.	Add new city state pair
5.	Delete all the cities for a given state

4.	Write a method that takes a string and returns the number of unique characters in the string. 
Pass a string with the same character sequence several times to the method. The counting operation is time consuming so the method should cache the results, so that when the method is given a string previously encountered, it will simply retrieve the stored result.
Use collections and maps where appropriate.
